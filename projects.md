Please feel free to add to the ideas and share which part of the project you would like to try to develop. 

**Data Visualization:**

1. (Adam) Get historical prices for the 42 stocks and simulate a trade taking place (after observation date) when the price falls between the enter_from and enter_to values.
    - Calculate how many stocks reached pt1, pt2, and pt3 after one week, two weeks, and one month (two scenarios: A. include the actual stop losses and B. set a standard 8% stop losses to all trades). Create Plotly graphs to show the results.
2. (Eszter) Calculate the amount of profit / loss of the complete trading portfolio. Also show profit / loss by sector, by trade type (long, short). Create Plotly graphs to show the results.
3. Based on Malini's idea to use S&P 500 data, compare portfolio's performance to the S&P 500 within the same timeframe
4. Incorporate [Technical Analysis](https://github.com/plotly/dash-technical-charting/tree/master) into the app

**AI Agent - Machine Learning Development:**

1. (Sandrine) Based on 's idea, use AlphaVantage to develop the [LSTM model](https://www.alphavantage.co/stock-prediction-deep-neural-networks-lstm/#predict-future-price) and test it on stocks from the dataest.
2. Use the same model to [predict future prices](https://www.alphavantage.co/stock-prediction-deep-neural-networks-lstm/#predict-future-price) of certain stocks.
3. Create an AI agent that is an expert in interpreting quarterly earning reports and transcripts from earning report calls
4. Create an AI agent that identifies technical indicators based on stock price movements
5. Develop a Decision-making AI agent that receives analyses from the other AIs and decides if, when, and how to enter a trade.
6. Once we have a model, use a backtesting platform (such as [VectorBT](https://vectorbt.dev/)) to test it on other stocks.

**Execution:**
1. (Ted) Create an AI that can execute trades [using Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) (to open or close trades)
